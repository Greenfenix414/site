<p>
The css game is a new additon to the site which involves keeping your mouse on a circle, and interacting with it by clicking.
The main goal of the game,(available <a href="/site/cssgame">here</a>) is to get to the end without your cursor leaving the circle, or being blocked by an obstacle.
Also first blog post! Yay!
